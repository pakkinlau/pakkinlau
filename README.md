## 🏘My Short-course Development Work

I have discovered a true passion for crafting articles that break down intricate concepts into easily digestible pieces. As a result, I am currently working on developing the following sets of materials for the public. Please remember to cite the source when using these materials.

### Status: Development stage 🌱

- [GPU-Environment-Windows-Linux-Docker](https://github.com/pakkinlau/GPU-Environment-Windows-Linux-Docker): When I first ventured into setting up a GPU-accelerated environment with CUDA and PyTorch, the process proved to be daunting and time-consuming. This was due to a couple of factors:
  - **Choice Overload**: With multiple setup methodologies available, it was unclear which combination of steps would yield a functional environment without trial and error.
  - **Component Complexity**: The setup involves integrating components from various providers, each independently maintained and with often opaque error messaging, which complicates troubleshooting.

  To help streamline this setup process, I've created a series of Jupyter notebooks that address different setup scenarios:
  - **CUDA-GPU Environment**: Detailed guides for various CUDA-GPU environment configurations, tailored to circumvent common pitfalls.
  - **Docker Approach**: Clear, step-by-step instructions for defining a Docker image, designed to be flexible and accommodate updates to underlying components.
  - **Demonstration Scripts**: Practical examples demonstrating how to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) in the configured environment, providing a quick start to harnessing their capabilities.

  These resources aim to minimize setup headaches and get you started with a robust data science platform, whether you're working in Windows or Linux, and whether you prefer a native installation or a Dockerized solution.

- [Multilingual-Semantic-Search-Course](https://github.com/pakkinlau/Multilingual-Semantic-Search-Course): Contextual embeddings generated by LLMs are the core technology used in semantic search. This short-course repository try to walk-through the environment setup, concepts involved, and also demonstrating some key steps of using those functions.

- [Big-Data-Integration-and-Processing-Course](https://github.com/pakkinlau/Big-Data-Integration-and-Processing-Course): This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering big data techniques, featuring:
  - Detailed software setup instruction 
  - **Integration Tools**: Introduction to MongoDB, a NoSQL database perfect for document integration, alongside strategies for effective data amalgamation.
  - **Processing Frameworks**: Tutorials and examples on using Apache Spark, the leading platform for large-scale data processing
  - Final project demonstration: Ddemonstrate how to integrate, update, query and delete data from a >1TB textual corpus. 

- [BigdataMath](https://github.com/pakkinlau/BigdataMath): During my learning journey, I've found that I possess the ability to create effective notes that can simplify complex concepts, making them more accessible and comprehensive. Consequently, I'm planning to write a series of articles covering a variety of topics in the field of mathematics related to big data, which is an area I have a strong interest in.
